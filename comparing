/*Football team A, has played three matches, and has scored { 1 , 2 , 3 } goals in each match
respectively.
 Football team B, has played two matches, and has scored { 2, 4 } goals in each match
respectively.
 Your task is to compute, for each match of team B, the total number of matches of team A,
where team A has scored less than or equal to the number of goals scored by team B in that
match.
 In the above case:
 For 2 goals scored by team B in its first match, team A has 2 matches with scores 1 and 2.
 For 4 goals scored by team B in its second match, team A has 3 matches with scores 1, 2 and
3.
Hence, the answer: {2, 3}. */
